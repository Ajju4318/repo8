Certainly! In Git, branches are an essential feature that allows for parallel development, enabling multiple lines of work to progress independently. Here's an overview of Git branches:

Creating Branches:
1. Create a New Branch:
# Create a new branch
git branch <branch_name>
 Switch to a Branch:
 # Switch to an existing branch
git checkout <branch_name>

# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
